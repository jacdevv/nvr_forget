# nvr_forget
An app developed specially for people struggling with dementia.

Want to demo?
You can ask questions like:
- What did I do on 22nd February?
- What did I want to cook for dinner?
- When did I started reading mystery novels?

Note that the text to speech may not work in the web as it requires exposing my OpenAI secret key (because I'm using flutter, there is no easy way). It works when hosted locally.
